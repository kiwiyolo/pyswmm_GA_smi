Combining the genetic algorithm with the SWMM model, the model parameters are automatically adjusted by an intelligent optimization algorithm, which improves the accuracy and optimization efficiency of the model. This method can automatically adapt to different rainfall events and urban environments, and has high universality and adaptability. 

It is proposed to use deep learning methods to build parameter optimization networks and sensitivity weights and carry out interpretability analysis.
